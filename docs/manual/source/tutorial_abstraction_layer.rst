Tutorial: ldap3 Abstraction Layer
#################################

**A more pythonic LDAP**: LDAP operations look clumsy and hard-to-use because they reflect the old-age idea that time-consuming operations
should be done on the client to not clutter and hog the server with unneeded elaboration. ldap3 includes a fully functional **Abstraction
Layer** that lets you interact with the DIT in a modern and *pythonic* way. With the Abstraction Layer you don't need to directly issue any
LDAP operation at all.
